# SELESCRIPT - "Scrapping the web made easy"

## What is **Selescript** ?

**Selescript** is both a compiler/translator and a langage.

From a small script, written in the **Selescript** langage, the **Selescript** compiler 
will generate a complete java application, compile and package it as a 
self-sustained, executable jar that can run anywhere, as long and as often as you need.

Running this executable jar will *scrap* the web, selecting and retrieving  
information, and automatically navigating from page to page. 

The scrapped data can be easily retrieved in various formats, from csv files to 
mongo database records.

## Enough talking, just show me the code !

### Linux

If you are already using Linux, follow the [quickstart](pages/quickstart.html) and you will be scrapping the web in minutes.
