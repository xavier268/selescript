# Scrapping the web made easy

## What is **Selescript** ?

**Selescript** is a langage designed to make web scrapping easier

Running a **selescript** script will *scrap* the web, selecting and retrieving  
information, and automatically navigating from page to page. 

The scrapped data can be easily retrieved in various formats, from csv files to 
mongo database records.

## Enough talking, just show me the code !

### Linux
