# selescript

_"Scrapping the web made easy"_

## What is **Selescript** ?

**Selescript** is both a compiler/translator and a langage.

From a small script, written in the Selecript langage, the Selescript compiler 
will generate a complete java application, compile and package it as a 
self-sustained, executable jar taht can run anywhere.

Running this executable jar will *scrap* the web, retrieving selecting 
information, and automatically navigating from pages to pages. 

The scrapped data can be easily retrieved in various formats, from csv files to 
mongo database records.

## Quickstart : enough talking, just show me !

### Linux



### Windows and OSX 

*Should work with some changes needed to the utility scripts.*
*Not tested yet. Anyone around wants to help ?*

## Selecript langage reference

## Javadoc APIs

There are two javadoc APIs :

* the API for Selescript itself
* the API for the runtime package that is used by the gererated class.
